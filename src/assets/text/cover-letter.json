	"body1": "I am a developer from central Massachusetts, with over 10 years of experience and a specialty in front end web development. I started off in a full stack role where I gained some broad software engineering experience (especially in networking and enterprise), and then I started a seven-year journey where I've been specializing in the React ecosystem. Mostly, my focus has been developing high quality user interfaces and using languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript, along with HTML and CSS.",
	"body2": "The kinds of projects I've been involved with have been numerous, from creating the website of a medical staffing firm, to working on the internal and customer-facing tools of a cloud storage company, to joining a startup making a crime pattern analysis web app. I've always emphasized being a team player and working towards a successful end product, rather than just getting my own job done.",
	"body3": "Beyond the dev world, I'm a generally nerdy individual who enjoys creating 2D games, cooking, and striving towards a number of fitness goals.",
	"conclusion": "Thank you for reading, and if you would enjoy working with a person like me, please consider giving me an opportunity to interview!",
